(Unfortunately I don't have a Windows machine available so I can't verify all these steps, I'll try my best with the help of Google)

1. @Bill, make sure our user (urmeek, or whichever username you chose) has the following "Administrative Roles" rights:
	Roles: DBManager, DBDesigner and BackupAdmin (in fact selecting DBManager should automatically activate the other two).
	This should give us all rights we need except for one, namely the Global Privilege "REFERENCES", please activate it so my code can correctly create all db tables.
	Here's a list of all Global Privileges I've tested it with: ALTER, ALTER ROUTINE, CREATE, CREATE ROUTINE, CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES, CREATE VIEW, DELETE, DROP, EVENT, GRANT OPTION, INDEX, INSERT, LOCK TABLES, REFERENCES, SELECT, SHOW DATABASES, SHOW VIEW, TRIGGER, UPDATE.

2. Download and install python 2.7:
	All available versions can be found here: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2711/
	Since the lab computer seems to run windows, I'd find out if the microprocessor is 32 or 64 bit (probably 64) and download the appropriate link:
		- 64-bit Windows: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.11/python-2.7.11.amd64.msi
		- 32-bit Windows: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.11/python-2.7.11.msi
		- Note: in order to find out if your windows is 32 or 64 bit, this is what Google says: "To find out if your computer is running a 32-bit or 64-bit version of Windows in Windows 7 or Windows Vista, do the following: Open System by clicking the Start button , right-clicking Computer, and then clicking Properties. Under System, you can view the system type".
		- Note 2: Found this tutorial online (http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/win/) that seems to be a good guide on how to setup Python, if I don't explain something correctly, that might help you.

3. Configure the PATH environment variable:
	According to the tutorial mentioned in Note 2 above, you can do this easily by running the following in PowerShell (Click on the Start Menu logo in the bottom left corner of the screen -> Type "PowerShell" on the search bar -> Right click -> Run as administrator):
		[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "$env:Path;C:\Python27\;C:\Python27\Scripts\", "User")

4. Install PIP utility (which allows to install other libraries):
	Download this script: https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
	Then, should be as easy as double-clicking on the file "get-pip.py" you just downloaded.
	Otherwise, you could manually run it by opening the Python app (should be an icon somewhere in the Start Menu -> Python), opening the script and executing it.

5. Download my code:
	Download the latest version from: https://github.com/CarlosRDomin/UrmeeUCR/archive/master.zip
	EXTRACT the zip file into a folder of your choosing, and open the folder.

6. Install dependencies:
	Open a command prompt (Start Menu -> (in the search bar type) cmd), navigate to the folder where the .zip was extracted and execute:
		pip install -r requirements.txt
	This should automatically install all the dependencies and libraries the code needs to run

7. Run my script:
	Open the folder where the .zip was extracted and execute (double-click) the file "run_server.py"
	And the server should be running! In order to stop it, close the window or press Ctrl + C (or Ctrl + D, not sure on Windows)
	
Different server parameters can be configured by modifying the files in the folder BargainingExperiment/config:
	db_settings.py (@Bill these are for you. I used the values you sent in an email, feel free to modify with any updated values):
		SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_USER: username to use when connecting to the MySQL server.
		SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_PASS: password to use when connecting to the MySQL server.
		SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_NAME: name of the db schema we have access to within the MySQL server.
		SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_SERVER: address of the MySQL server.
	experiment_settings.py (@Urmee these are for you):
		NUMBER_OF_USERS: this number indicates the total number of users that will be participating in the experiment, and that the server will wait for before starting the first match.
		INTEREST_PER_ROUND: (not used yet by my code, but ready for next iteration) indicates the interest applied to the profit a user would obtain for closing a deal over their valuation.
	
Note: you should modify the settings BEFORE executing the server for them to take effect.

8. Test the server:
	In order to connect to it (as if you were a user doing the experiment), you need to find out the local IP address of the lab computer acting as the server. We can do this by opening a terminal (Start Menu -> (search bar) cmd) and typing "ipconfig" (and press Enter).
	A bunch of information will come out, but there should be a line saying "IPv4 Address". The number across from it is your local IP address. Typical examples of local IPs to look for are: "192.168.0.x", "192.168.1.x", "10.0.0.x", "172.16.0.x", etc.
	Once you find it, simply open Google Chrome in any lab computer (including the server itself, should also work there), and type the following URL: "localIP:5000" (eg: 192.168.0.5:5000). Then just follow the instructions on the screen on how to "play" our experiment :D
