(Unfortunately I don't have a Windows machine available so I can't verify all these steps, I'll try my best with the help of Google)
1. Download and install MySQL (latest version as of June 7th 2016 is 5.7.13):
	Instructions extracted from here: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/windows-installation.html
	Simply download the MSI installer (http://dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/MySQLInstaller/mysql-installer-community-5.7.13.0.msi) and follow the installation steps.

2. Create a MySQL user for the database:
	Among other things, MySQLWorkbench should have been installed in the previous step. Find it in the Start Menu and open it.
	On a black screen, a popup item should read "Local instance <number>". Click on it to connect.
	On the left menu, under MANAGEMENT, click on Users and Privileges. Then, on the "Add account" button on the bottom left corner. Fill out the fields (on the Login tab):
		Login name: Urmee
		Limit to Hosts Matching: localhost
		Password: UCRexperiment.1
	Under the Administrative Roles tab, check the following boxes:
		DBManager (which will also activate DBDesigner and Backup Admin) from the main list
		REFERENCES from the right list
	Finally, click on the "Apply" button on the bottom right corner.

3. Download and install python 2.7:
	All available versions can be found here: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2711/
	Since the lab computer seems to run windows, I'd find out if the microprocessor is 32 or 64 bit (probably 64) and download the appropriate link:
		- 64-bit Windows: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.11/python-2.7.11.amd64.msi
		- 32-bit Windows: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.11/python-2.7.11.msi
		- Note: in order to find out if your windows is 32 or 64 bit, this is what Google says: "To find out if your computer is running a 32-bit or 64-bit version of Windows in Windows 7 or Windows Vista, do the following: Open System by clicking the Start button , right-clicking Computer, and then clicking Properties. Under System, you can view the system type".
		- Note 2: Found this tutorial online (http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/win/) that seems to be a good guide on how to setup Python, if I don't explain something correctly, that might help you.

4. Configure the PATH environment variable:
	According to the tutorial mentioned in Note 2 above, you can do this easily by running the following in PowerShell (Click on the Start Menu logo in the bottom left corner of the screen -> Type "PowerShell" on the search bar -> Right click -> Run as administrator):
		[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "$env:Path;C:\Python27\;C:\Python27\Scripts\", "User")

5. Install PIP utility (which allows to install other libraries):
	Download this script: https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
	Then, should be as easy as double-clicking on the file "get-pip.py" you just downloaded.
	Otherwise, you could manually run it by opening the Python app (should be an icon somewhere in the Start Menu -> Python), opening the script and executing it.

6. Download my code:
	Download the latest version from: https://github.com/CarlosRDomin/UrmeeUCR/archive/master.zip
	EXTRACT the zip file into a folder of your choosing, and open the folder.

7. Install dependencies:
	Open a command prompt (Start Menu -> (in the search bar type) cmd), navigate to the folder where the .zip was extracted and execute:
		pip install -r requirements.txt
	This should automatically install all the dependencies and libraries the code needs to run

8. Run my script:
	Open the folder where the .zip was extracted and execute (double-click) the file "run_server.py"
	And the server should be running! In order to stop it, close the window or press Ctrl + C (or Ctrl + D, not sure on Windows)
	Note: you can configure different server parameters by modifying the file UrmeeExperiment/experiment_settings.py:
		NUMBER_OF_USERS: this number indicates the total number of users that will be participating in the experiment, and that the server will wait for before starting the first match.
		INTEREST_PER_ROUND: (not used yet by my code, but ready for next iteration) indicates the interest applied to the profit a user would obtain for closing a deal over their valuation.
	Note that you should modify the settings BEFORE executing the server!

9. Test the server:
	In order to connect to it (as if you were a user doing the experiment), you need to find out the local IP address of the lab computer acting as the server. We can do this by opening a terminal (Start Menu -> (search bar) cmd) and typing "ipconfig" (and press Enter).
	A bunch of information will come out, but there should be a line saying "IPv4 Address". The number across from it is your local IP address. Typical examples of local IPs to look for are: "192.168.0.x", "192.168.1.x", "10.0.0.x", "172.16.0.x", etc.
	Once you find it, simply open Google Chrome in any lab computer (including the server itself, should also work there), and type the following URL: "localIP:5000" (eg: 192.168.0.5:5000). Then just follow the instructions on the screen on how to "play" our experiment :D
